The rows in the database tables represent the infrastructure in your cloud account. Our dashboard provisions a PostgreSQL database for you and configures it to manage an AWS account and region. The database is automatically backfilled with all your existing cloud resources. Which tables are loaded into an IaSQL database is configured based on what IaSQL modules are installed in a db. Every IaSQL module represents a cloud service like awsec2 or awselb. Once the desired modules are installed with the install IaSQL PostgreSQL function, run INSERT or UPDATE queries on the database by using the PG connection string displayed when you first set up in the dashboard with your preferred PostgreSQL client. Finally run the iasql_apply PostgreSQL function to provision infrastructure in your cloud account based on the IaSQL db.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"how-to/aws":{"id":"how-to/aws","title":"Manage an AWS Account","description":"IaSQL requires cloud credentials to manage and provision resources which can be provided in one of two ways.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"how-to/connect":{"id":"how-to/connect","title":"Connecting to PostgreSQL","description":"The required information to connect to a PostgreSQL IaSQL database will provided when you connect an AWS account when provisioning the database.
